                <h2>Space++ needs YOU!</h2>
<p class="meta">07 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<ul>
<li>You are students having trouble finding place to do school project together?</li>
<li>You are entrepreneurs filled with ideas but can’t find anywhere to discuss?</li>
<li>You are freelancers without a true and professional workplace?</li>
<li>You are a NGO/Non-profit organization and meeting online doesn&#39;t work?</li>
<li>You are a normal person who need a place to focus, to be inspired and to experience the feeling of a professional yet cozy workplace?</li>
</ul>

<p>This idea came from an annoying fact: We all need somewhere to work, to get things done, so we can achieve more and can climb up higher and higher in the education or career ladder. We work for the bosses, for customers, for ourselves, and we always get mad working in our own boring office, without enough openly green spaces to balance your mind.</p>

<p>This is for us, and you. This is for everyone. A space for more than just chatting. A space for more than just sitting and have a nice view and enjoy a good cup of coffee. This is for the ideas to grow, for the discussion, the brainstorming process and meetings to work out effectively. Space++ is for the productivity of anyone for any work at anytime.</p>

<p>We provide anything you need in a professional workplace, from the very basic photocopy service, papers, clips, pencils, etc. to DSLR cameras, color printers, scanning machine and super strong WiFi network. Moreover, we provide the space and services included for the events such as workshops, seminars, networking event, sale fair.</p>

<p>The key point here is you are not only come and leave, you have a place for you to leave your branding mark, both online and offline (on a board - just like Pinterest). This will be the opportunity for you to hunt for a job, or to find your co-founder in your startup, or maybe... a friend. This is the network focus on real people, real information and real chances to reach people, since all of the data will be collected from the real customers and companies which have come to Space++.</p>

<p>This is gonna be a huge load of work, currently my team now has me as creative director, an IT director and a financial director. Unfortunately, they can’t attend this bootcamp with me so I’m in need of 3-4 teammates. Come to me and together we save the youth!</p>
